<ul>
  <h3>Time spent</h3>
  <li>Planning: 1hr</li>
  <p>I drew my components, planned where my state should live and created a plan for how the logic should work</p>
  <li>Creating logic: 3 hrs</li>
  <p></p>
  <li>Initial Design: 2hrs</li>
  <li>Matching .png perfectly: about 3 hrs</li>
  <p>From toggling shadows between 8px and 7px to managing padding I spent a decent amount of time trying to make a pixel perfect recreation of the source files.</p>
  <li>Deploying and cleaning up: 30 mins</li>
  <li>Total: 9.5hrs</li>
</ul>

<p>I accomplished all of the core goals and the stretch goals. I had to stop before implementing the bonus stretch goals simply for the sake of time.</p>
